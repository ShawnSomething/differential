Differential is a Service Orchestration Framework that enables developers to turn a set of functions into a typesafe service, without spending additional effort on managing service contracts, network communication, searialization/deserialization service authentication or infrastructure configuration. The latter concerns are completely abstracted away from the developer, and are handled by Differential.

It is designed to:
- Lower the barrier to entry for a service-oriented architecture
- Make it significantly cheaper to run a service-oriented architecture
- Provide a delightful developer experience for building and evolving services
