### Bug Fixes

* Allow parallel function executions upto concurrency limit ([e431ff3](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/e431ff3cd41bce61a460e2bc89858d526c25df85))
* Allow services to start idempotently ([bf1c307](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/bf1c3079f1e8c4be56f9953a42c20e829397d8e1))
* **client:** Polling is now service specific. Each service can poll independently ([f7c160d](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/f7c160dca51b73fd2ed9a8d2eb2df1a96f02d5a0))
* Fix types to be more strict on call and background ([ec29dd2](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/ec29dd2d75a3e9a1a950f17e914ba8300d925333))
* **listeners:** Let listener params be optional ([eb24277](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/eb2427797213c61ecf95df6632290826aeefa1d9))


### Features

* Adding function support ([372b897](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/372b897dbad2ea3b871d6e5c0bdb28d121995cd8))
* Adding long polling support for control-plane ([98a6b69](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/98a6b69b340cfa67c3fa1759d0de9cfdf6c8f7ec))
* **sdk:** Add setConcurrency to dynamically change host concurrency ([fcbbd40](https://github.com/differentialHQ/differential/commit/fcbbd401ec3aa0356aaf7e5b43d38d700c3974a4))
