## The What
Differential is a Service Orchestration Framework that enables developers to turn any function into a typesafe service, without spending additional effort on managing service contracts, network communication, service authentication or infrastructure configuration.

It is designed to allow your code to be written in a monolithic way, but deployed as a set of independent services, and currently has first class support for Typescript.

## The Why
Two reasons:
- Lower the barrier to entry for a service-oriented architecture
- Make it significantly cheaper to run a service-oriented architecture
